# fshare 🚀

fshare is a self-hosted, encrypted file storage and sharing web application built with **Node.js**, **Express**, **MySQL**, and **vanilla JavaScript**.  
It lets users securely upload, store, share, and manage files through a clean web dashboard, with per-user quotas and server-side encryption support.

# Security Notes 🔒
  - **Encryption Key Handling**: The encryption key is provided by the user and stored in browser localStorage; the server never permanently stores it.

  - **Password Hashing**: All passwords are stored hashed with bcrypt.

  - **Link Expiration**: Shared links are automatically deleted when expired.
